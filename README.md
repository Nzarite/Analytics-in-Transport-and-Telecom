This Repository contains Assignments and Project code of my academic course IME639 **(Analytics in Transport and Telecom)**.

This course is concerned with quantitative modeling for optimizing the design and operation of
systems arising in **Transportation** and **Telecommunication** industries. From a modeling
perspective Transport and Telecom share a number of common characteristics, as both are
concerned with design of network like structures involving flow of either physical goods or
information. The course includes a number of combinatorial optimization models, and heuristic
algorithms for solving such models.

## Assignment 1
Implementing the column generation approach for solving the cutting stock problem.<br>
Detailed instructions are given in [/Assignment 1/steps.txt](https://github.com/Nzarite/Analytics-in-Transport-and-Telecom/blob/1fd742fe3baa99561fe1b9f1846b03f01932e138/Assignment%201/steps.txt) file.
